## Exercise 1-1

### 4. 

- Reflexive: $\phi(a) = \phi(a) \Rightarrow a \sim a$.

- Symmetric: $a \sim b \Rightarrow \phi(a) = \phi(b) \Rightarrow \phi(b) = \phi(a) \Rightarrow b \sim a $.

- transitive: if $a \sim b $ and $b \sim c$, then $\phi(a) = \phi(b) = \phi(c)$, which means $a \sim c$.

  So relation $\sim$is an equivalence relation.

  the patition that a belongs to is $[a] = \{ b \mid \phi(b) = \phi(a) \}$.
